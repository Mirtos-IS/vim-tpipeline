INTRODUCTION						*tpipeline-external-introduction*

This plugin is not limited to embedding the statusline in tmux only. The
statusline can be embedded in arbitrary external programs. The
|g:tpipeline_refreshcmd| option already allows running arbitrary commands to
trigger the update of an external statusline.

The |g:tpipeline_size| option allows to configure the size of the rendered
statusline, which usually should be set to the numerical size of the external
statusline, i.e. the number of characters or columns that fit into it.

Depending on the external program, some integration needs to be done on that
side as well. There exists full documentation for some external programs in
|tpipeline-external-examples|.
